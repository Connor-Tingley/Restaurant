			<h1>About Ike's Place</h1>
			<p>Ike’s Place first opened its door on Halloween of 2007. The man behind the sandwich, Ike Shehadeh, always puts his customers happiness first. That is what sets Ike’s Place aside from the rest. When you come to Ike’s Place it is our goal to make you feel like the unique individual that you are. If that isn’t enough to set us aside, did I mention that the bread is baked fresh to order? And our soon to be patented “Ike’s Dirty Secret Sauce” is spread on every sandwich and baked right in the bread, and another layer is spread on afterwards to give it that extra flavor. Mmmmm… are you hungry yet?</p>
